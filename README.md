# Image Editor
Canvas image editor

This is an image editor, replacing the arrow function (=>) in the source of the [toast image editor](https://github.com/nhnent/tui.image-editor) with a regular function in JavaScript.

Because the arrow function does not work under IE 11,
With this modification, the toast image editor can be used from IE9 to IE11.
